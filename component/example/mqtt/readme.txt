Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
        This is an example to use the MQTT APIs in example_mqtt.c. 
	
Setup Guide
~~~~~~~~~~~
	To execute this example automatically when booting, configuration should be set as below.
	1) The CONFIG_EXAMPLE_MQTT in platform_opts.h must be enabled as follows.
	    /* platform_opts.h *./
	    #define CONFIG_EXAMPLE_MQTT 1
	For AmebaD2 :Amebad2 Changes how example is compiled, and Removed macro controls (CONFIG_EXAMPLE_XXX)in platform_opts.h
		1.GCC:use CMD "make xip EXAMPLE=mqtt" to compile mqtt example

	   To manage connection exception, LWIP_TCP_KEEPALIVE and LWIP_UART_ADAPTER in 
	   lwipopts.h must be enabled as follows.
	    /* lwipopts.h */
	    #define LWIP_TCP_KEEPALIVE 1
	    #define LWIP_UART_ADAPTER 1
	2) Add example_mqtt() to Example_entry.c.
	    #if CONFIG_EXAMPLE_MQTT
	    #include <mqtt/example_mqtt.h>
	    #endif
	    void example_entry(void)
	    {
	        #if CONFIG_EXAMPLE_MQTT
	        example_mqtt();
	        #endif
	    }
	3) under gcc: make sure that the mqtt example source file has been added to the project
	   under IAR: lm4_application->application->mqtt->options, don't choose 
	      "exclude from build"
	
Result description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	In the example, MQTT task is created to present MQTT connection and message processing, including:
	    1) Check WIFI status and wait WIFI to be connected. MQTT will start after device connected 
	       with AP and got IP.
	    2) Establish TCP/IP connection with MQTT server.
	    3) Send a CONNECT message to server and wait for a CONNACK message from server.
	    4) Subscribe to a topic, sending SUBSCRIBE to server and wait for SUBACK from server.
	    5) Publish message to server every 5 seconds.
	    6) Read and response message. Keep alive with server.
	    7) If mqtt status is set to MQTT_START, the client will close the TCP/IP socket connection, and
	       restart the session by opening a new socket to the server and issuing a CONNECT message.
	       The client will subscribe to the topic again.
        Some strategies are used to manage connection exception
	    1) Lwip_select is used to check data arrival and connection exception. Message is read only if
	       tcp data has arrived. If exception fd is set, MQTT will restart.
	    2) SO_KEEPALIVE and TCP_KEEPIDLE are set to clear TCP buffer when network is bad. For if
               TCP buffer is full and can¡¦t allocate more memory, the situation will last for about 20
	       minutes until MAX data retries reached, and then MQTT will not restart successfully during
	       this time for allocating memory failed.
